# SLAM Learning Notes


It's a personal SLAM Learning Note Record. The content includes two books `Computer Vision: A Modern Approach (Second Edition)` and `Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision`, as well as a series of SLAM papers like `ORB_SLAM` and their codes.

The notes are mainly written in Chinese. If you are interested or you are learning the same thesis as me, feel free to discuss it with me.
